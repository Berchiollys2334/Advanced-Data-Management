# Advanced-Data-Management

This is my performance assesment for D326 (Advanced Data Management).

The project was foucsed around providing one real-world written business report that can be created from the PostgreSQL sample database (dvdrental). 

My business problem focused on creating a report that determined sales performance by film category. I suggested that this report could be used to optimize inventory management, and enhance decision-making based on top performing film categories.
